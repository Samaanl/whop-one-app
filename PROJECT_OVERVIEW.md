## Design Philosophy

### Minimal & Typography-Driven

- **Colors:** White background, gray text, black accents
- **Fonts:** Geist Sans (light weight for premium feel)
- **Layout:** Centered, max-width containers
- **Animations:** Subtle fade-ins only

### Mobile-First

- Responsive breakpoints
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Readable font sizes on all screens

### No Distractions

- Content is the hero
- Minimal UI chrome
- Clean, whitespace-heavy layouts

---

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented:**

- Server-side access verification
- Whop user token validation
- Admin-only routes for content creation
- Environment variables for secrets

🔒 **Best Practices:**

- Never expose `WHOP_API_KEY` to client
- Always verify access on server before returning data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all inputs

---

## Performance Optimizations

- Client-side routing (Next.js)
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Minimal JavaScript bundle
- Optimized images (if added)
- Indexed database queries
